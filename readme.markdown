# CSS Less templating

This is a small POC to demonstrate a way to use themes with Less. 

`light-theme.html` and `dark-theme.html` each use their respective `light-theme.css` and `dark-theme.css` file. They're both inserted into `index.html` via iframes.

The Light Theme uses light colors but is otherwise as default, while the Dark Theme uses dark colors, as well as overwrite some text styling.
